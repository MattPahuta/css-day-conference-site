## Overview

I undertook this quick two-page site project to brush up on CSS fundamentals and best practices. Though most of my work currently involves using libraries and frameworks to build and style sites, I find this practice of going back to the basics useful in reminding myself to keep things as simple as possible. However, this particular workshop proved to be much too introductory for me. Additionally, there were quite a few approaches used by the instructor that were pretty far removed from where I would have landed. In the end, I left the course project only about 75% complete, though I did watch the full course content.
