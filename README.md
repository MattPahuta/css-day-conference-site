## Overview

I undertook this quick two page site project to brush up on some CSS fundamentals and best practices, as I like to do from time to time. Though most of my work involves using libraries and frameworks to build and style sites, I find that it's beneficial to periodically to strip those layers of abstraction away and return to the nuts and bolts of web development. 

I find this process of returning to the fundamentals and watching up-to-date tutorials and workshops presenting fundamentals useful in reminding myself to stop over-engineering my CSS and using more markup than is absolutely necessary. It's an issue I see in a lot of my early work and practice projects--too many html elements (primarily divs) and too much reliance on flex and grid styles when some simple margins will do.

### Project requirements

Users should be able to:

- Example: View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- Example: See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.


### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

### Useful resources
